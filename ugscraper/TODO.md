- Write parser for song results list to get all songs, parse each song then go to next page
- Write parser for depth first search of tags
  - Write caching for tag combinations
  - Write caching for song versions

- Genres and subgenres are not mutually exclusive
- Genres and subgenres are not hierarchical
- Categories do OR rather than AND when multiple are selected
